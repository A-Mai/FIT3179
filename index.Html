        <div id="MapDiv"> 
            <p class="heading">Happiness Index of Countries around the World</p>
            <div id="chloropleth"></div>
            <p class="paragraph">The World Happiness Index is a ranking of national happiness based on the
                Cantril Ladder survey (thus the ladder score). Respondents rate their life on a 0 to 10 scale,
                with 0 being the worst possible life and 10 being the best possible. Thus country rankings don't
                actually go to 0 or 10 as they are averaged scores. The highest ranked country is 
                <span class='westernEurope_text'>Finland</span> with a score
                of 7.842 and the lowest ranked country is  <span class='southAsia_text'>Afghanistan</span> at 2.523
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> From this graph, outliers when it comes to state happiness 
                in a region can be found. <span class='latinAmericaCarribean_text'>Venezuela</span> and 
                <span class='latinAmericaCarribean_text'>Haiti</span> are uniquely unhappy  
                in their geographic region while <span class='commonwealthIndependentStates_text'>Khazakstan</span>, 
                <span class='commonwealthIndependentStates_text'>Uzbekistan</span>, 
                <span class='middleEastNorthAfrica_text'>Saudi Arabia</span>, 
                <span class='middleEastNorthAfrica_text'>United Arab Emirates</span>, 
                and <span class='southeastAsia_text'>Thailand</span> are happier than their neighbours. </p>

    <div id="scatterplotDiv"></div>
        <p class="heading">Happiness Index Against GDP Per Capita (Logged)</p>
        <div class="ChartDiv">
            <div id="scatterplot"> </div>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">Directly from the graph, it can be seen that there is a correlation
            between happiness and GDP per capita, as well as healthy life expectancy. When adjusting the sliders,
            one can also see that there is some correlation with corruption perception and social support with 
            the other factors. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Interesting outliers that can be seen when interacting includes 
            <span class='subSaharanAfrica_text'>Rwanda</span>, with 
            a low happiness index and GDP per capita, yet is extrodinarily low in corruption perception at 
            second lowest behind <span class='southeastAsia_text'>Singapore</span>.

        <div id="barTitle">Average Data by Region</div> 
        <div id="barParagraph">The average data presents similar findings to that of the scatterplot graph 
            above, mainly that <span class='northAmericaANZ_text'>North America</span> and ANZ have the highest happiness on 
            average followed by <span class='westernEurope_text'>Western Europe</span>. 
            This is despite the <span class='westernEurope_text'>Western European</span> region having 
            some higher happiness countries, they are more spread out.
